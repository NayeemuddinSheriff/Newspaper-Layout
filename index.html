            <p>HBO Max will debut the project in 2021 — possibly in a four-hour director's cut or in six TV-style
                "chapters" — as the helmer gets the gang back together with the original postproduction crew to score,
                cut and finish visual effects.
                It was very early on a Monday morning in November when director Zack Snyder and his wife and producing
                partner, Deborah Snyder, received a call from their agent. Let’s be a bit more precise: It was 7 a.m.
                But more importantly, it was the day after the second anniversary of the release of Justice League, the
                DC superhero movie that Snyder was forced to exit due to a family emergency, which was then
                substantially reshot and retooled by replacement director Joss Whedon.</p>
            <p>In the time since its release, something unusual happened: A growing movement of fans, rallied by the
                hashtag #ReleasetheSnyderCut, had called, agitated, petitioned — even bought a Times Square billboard
                and chartered a plane to fly a banner over Comic-Con — for Snyder’s version to be released. And on the
                film's second anniversary, the hashtag had its biggest day ever — with even the movie's stars Gal Gadot
                and Ben Affleck adding their voices on Twitter.</p>

                    <p>An electric car is an automobile that is propelled by one or more electric motors, using energy
                        stored in rechargeable batteries. The first practical electric cars were produced in the
                        1880s.[1]
                        Electric cars were popular in the late 19th century and early 20th century, until advances in
                        internal
                        combustion engines, electric starters in particular, and mass production of cheaper petrol
                        (gasoline) and
                        diesel vehicles led to a decline in the use of electric drive vehicles.</p>

            <h2>A CHINESE COMPANY TO BUILD A FAKE MOOON TO REPLACE THE CITY</h2>
            <font>Reference Wikipedia,Google</font>
            <br>
            <p>A Chinese company has announced ambitious plans to put a "fake moon" into space to brighten the night
                sky.According to the People's Daily state newspaper, officials at a private aerospace institute in
                Chengdu want to launch this "illumination satellite" in orbit by 2020, and say it will be bright enough
                to replace street lights.</p>
            <p>The straight-out-of-sci-fi news has sparked fascination, scepticism from scientists, lots of
                questions and outright mockery.</p>
            <p>
                Mr Wu said the idea had been in testing for a few years and the technology was now in place to make it
                happen, with a launch scheduled for 2020.The China Daily newspaper quoted Mr Wu as saying that three
                "huge mirrors" could be launched by 2022.It's not clear from any of the reports whether this project has
                any official backing.
            </p>
            <p>It would orbit 500km about Earth - roughly the same height as the International Space Station. The Moon
                orbits, on average, about 380,000km above Earth.
                The reports gave no details about what the fake moon would look like, but Mr Wu said it would reflect
                sunlight across an area of between 10km and 80km with brightness "eight times" that of the real Moon.

                <font>President Donald Trump said on Friday that the US has already produced two million vaccine doses
                    for the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) that are “ready to go” if they “check out for safety”.“We had
                    a meeting on vaccines yesterday. We are doing incredibly well. We can have some very positive
                    surprises. Tremendous progress is being made on vaccines,” Trump said during a news conference from
                    the White House.

                    “In fact, we are ready to go in terms of transportation and logistics. We have over two million

                    stocks now trade well below their long-term averages, throwing up many value buying opportunities.
